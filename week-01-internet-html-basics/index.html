  <h2>What is the Internet?</h2>
  <p>
    The Internet is a global network of computers that communicate
    with each other to share information.
  </p>

  <h2>How Websites Work</h2>
  <p>
    A website works using a client–server model. The browser
    (client) sends a request to a server, and the server sends
    back a response in the form of a web page.
  </p>

  <h2>HTTP and HTTPS</h2>
  <p>
    HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data on the web.
    HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP that encrypts data.
  </p>
